# Notes

* GitHub doesn't recognize the language correctly, and instead recognizes it as Pug.

* JADE is a proprietary language and requires a license to use their IDE. This IDE is a workaround, but I will still need to license it to be safe. I won't compromise my values in the process, and I will abandon if needed.
